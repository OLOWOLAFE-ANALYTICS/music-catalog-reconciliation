# Music Catalog Reconciliation Tool

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an automated solution for reconciling large music databases (20,000+ rows). It uses fuzzy matching logic to identify duplicates and unique records across catalogs with inconsistent metadata.

## Features
* *Fuzzy Matching:* Handles variations like "The Beatles" vs "Beatles" or "&" vs "and".
* *Visual Dashboard:* Summary tables providing a high-level view of catalog health.
* *Automated Status:* Conditional formatting to highlight Unique (Red), Exact (Green), and Fuzzy (Yellow) matches.

## How to Use
1. Download the .xlsx file in this repository.
2. Open the *Summary Report* tab to see the logic.
3. View the *Matching Details* tab to see the engine in action.

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query (M Language)
* Conditional Formatting Logic
